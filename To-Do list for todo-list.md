# To-Do list for todo-list

## _An ironic list of features I'd like to implement._

---
__User Experience:__
- Drag & drop sorting of tasks. User can click and hold a task, and drag to move it in the list.
- Subtasks & Task groups. Tasks can have optional subtasks that need to be completed in order to complete the parent task. Useful for big tasks with many steps, or for people (like me) who find it easier to do tasks if they're broken into smaller steps.
- Priority assignment. Optional tag you can add to tasks to show how much of a priority that task is. (High, medium, low), and color assignment so you can see at a glance what needs to be done ASAP and what can be put on the back burner for now. Would also like to implement an option to sort by priority.
- Due dates & reminders. Add a date picker and browser notifications
- Search & filtering. Let users search tasks or filter by status (completed/active/priority)
- Undo/Redo actions. Implement a history stack to undo accidental deletions.
- Improve UI & Animations.

__Productivity Boosters:__
- Progress tracking. Show a progress bar/percentage of completed tasks.
- Recurring tasks. "Repeat every monday" or "Repeat once a month" for cyclical tasks.
- Pomodoro timer integration. Start a 25-minute timer for focused work on a task
- Notes/Attachments. Let users add text notes or upload files (Images, PDFs) to tasks.
- Keyboard shortcuts. e.g, Ctrl + D to Delete a task, integration with other future features.

__Advanced Technical Features (If I get this far):__
- User Accounts & Sync. Sync tasks across devices
- Voice Input.
- Offline Mode
- API/Integrations. Connect to Google Calendar, Slack, Trello.
